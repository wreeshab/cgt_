## Features

- **Check if a Sequence is Graphic (Havel-Hakimi Algorithm)**: Verify if a given degree sequence can form a simple graph.
- **Generate Graph from Degree Sequence**: Construct a graph based on a valid degree sequence.
- **Eulerian Path and Circuit Detection**: Determine if a graph has an Eulerian path or circuit and find the Eulerian traversal using Fleury’s algorithm.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s Algorithm)**: Calculate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from a weighted graph.
- **Fundamental Cutsets and Circuits**: Compute the fundamental cutsets and circuits based on the MST.
- **Connectivity**: Calculate edge connectivity, vertex connectivity, and K-connectivity of the graph.
- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path**: Find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the graph, MST, Eulerian path, fundamental cutsets, and circuits.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **NetworkX**: For graph data structures and algorithms
- **Matplotlib**: For graph visualization
